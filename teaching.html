          <p><div class="course-title">ISTE-266 Design For Accessibility.</div> This course covers the design, evaluation, and use of accessible systems for disabled people and older adults. Students will learn about accessible design, how to interpret accessibility laws and use best practice accessibility guidelines, and how to identify user needs to build accessible systems.</p>

          <h1>2022</h1>
          <h2>Fall</h2>
          <p><div class="course-title">HCIN-620 Information and Interaction Design.</div> This course focuses on current design practices to facilitate perception and understanding of information through representation and organization, as well as specifying the appropriate mechanisms for accessing and manipulating task information. Students explore various design patterns and gain prototyping experience through a semester-long group project.</p>

          <h2>Spring</h2>
          <p><div class="course-title">HCIN-630 Usability Testing.</div> This course is centered around projects from industry clients. Each student team will work with a client to formally evaluate the user interface of a system or website. During the course, students will also learn about usability evaluation goals, recruitmenting appropriate users, designing evaluations tasks, analysising findings, and documentation results.</p>

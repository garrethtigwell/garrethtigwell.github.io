	<h1>There are 5 funded PhD student positions available from HCI faculty at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT).</h1>
	<p>RIT faculty conduct a broad range of HCI research, including in the areas of ubiquitous computing, user experience, haptics and wearables, communication, and accessibility.  RIT has a dynamic HCI research community (<a href="http://hci-research.rit.edu">http://hci-research.rit.edu</a>), with faculty, students, and research centers across the university.  PhD students also benefit from RIT's membership in the HCI Consortium (<a href="https://hcic.org/about.phtml">https://hcic.org/about.phtml</a>), an organization of top universities, companies, and government research labs in the field of HCI.</p>
	<p>The HCI faculty below are also affiliated with the Center for Accessibility and Inclusion Research (CAIR, <a href="http://cair.rit.edu">http://cair.rit.edu</a>), which is a community of 40 faculty and students who publish research at leading computing conferences and journals, with a focus on HCI and accessibility for diverse users, including people who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing (DHH), people who are blind, people with communication impairments, and older adults.  CAIR faculty have secured over $3.5 million in external research funding since 2014, more than 100 peer-reviewed journal and conference papers, and twelve Best Paper and Honorable Mention Awards from major research venues, including the ACM CHI and ASSETS conferences.  CAIR includes several DHH researchers, and the RIT campus is enriched by the presence of the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID), with over 1,300 DHH students.</p>
	<h2>Faculty Seeking PhD Students:</h2>
	<p>Mingming Fan, Assistant Professor, researches at the intersection of HCI/UX, Accessibility, Mobile and Wearable Sensing, and Machine Learning (ML). He studies usersâ€™ experiences (e.g., usability problems) through subtle behavioral signals via user-centered design (UCD) and designs interactive intelligent applications utilizing sensing and ML technologies. His work includes ML-assisted analytical tools for UX practitioners, guidelines for senior-friendly instructions design, and applications of wearable sensing and ML technologies for accessibility, in particular for older adults and people with visual impairments.

	<p>Tae Oh,  Associate Professor, researches assistive technologies for people who are blind or visually impaired (BVI) or deaf or hard of hearing (DHH), especially in smart cane, indoor navigation, haptic communication, drop-off detection and security+ privacy.  In these areas, he studies effective front and overhead obstacle detections, accurate indoor navigation for people who are BVI, effective haptic feedback design for cane handle, security and privacy technologies for BVI and DHH users, and siren detection for DHH users.  His work includes smart cane performance evaluation, haptic prototypes for the handle, Android siren detection, and indoor navigation prototypes.

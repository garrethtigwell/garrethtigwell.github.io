	<p>Hello.</p>
	<p>I'm Garreth Tigwell, an Assistant Professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology.</p>
	<p>My research interests cover design, accessibility, and human-computer interaction.</p>
	<p><strong>Want to do a PhD with me?</strong> I'm always looking to work with new students, so please drop me an email.</p>
	<p>I obtained my PhD from the University of Dundee.</p>
	<p>A list of my work can be found here: <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=It8_yJwAAAAJ&hl=en">google scholar profile</a></p>
	<p>One day I will work on this website, but at least it is accessible!</p>
